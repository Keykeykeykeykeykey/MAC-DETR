# MAC-DETR
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:
MAC-DETR: Mamba for Robust Object Detection in High-Resolution Remote Sensing

ðŸ“„ The full paper will be available upon publication. This repository will be updated with the link.

# Dataset Preparation
Our model is evaluated on three public datasets. Please follow the instructions below to prepare them.

1.HRSC2016

Description: A dataset for ship detection in aerial imagery.

Download: [Obtain the dataset from IEEE DataPort - HRSC2016.](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/hrsc2016)

2.DOTA

Description: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images with oriented bounding boxes (OBB).

Download: [Clone the repository from Aerial-YOLO-DOTA or visit the official DOTA website for the original data.](https://github.com/davidgeorgewilliams/Aerial-YOLO-DOTA)

3.NWPU-VHR-10

Description: A ten-class object detection dataset for very high-resolution remote sensing images.

Download: [Clone the repository from NWPU-VHR-10.](https://github.com/Gaoshuaikun/NWPU-VHR-10)
